Haha , herken het meteen . Landgoed Huys te Warmont . Prachtige plek om eens een rondje te lopen . Heel afwisselend bos , veel water , stukjes grasland , oude bomen en natuurlijk het 'kasteel ' . [ Deze LINK heb ik daar genomen . Edit : LINK hangt hij trouwens in m ' n moeder haar appartement ( 3x2.65m ) . Edit : Since this is approaching /r/all : OP 's photo was taken from a forest in Warmond , which is located in the metropolitan area of The Netherlands , between Leiden and Amsterdam . The forest is called 'Landgoed Huys te Warmont ' and is a very nice area to spend about one and a half hour ( it 's not big ) . The name translates to something like : House of Warmont estate . Where the house is a castle located in the middle of the forest . The photo I linked above is taken there ( of which a big print is now on a wall in my mom 's apartment ) . From one of the edges of the forest ( where OP 's photo was taken ) you can see a lot of typically Dutch 'polders ' : Areas of land claimed from the water that are mostly below the water level of surrounding canals . These specific polders are mostly used for cattle . Most of them do n't have any bridges leading to them , so everything has to be transported to the polders by boat , including cows : )
