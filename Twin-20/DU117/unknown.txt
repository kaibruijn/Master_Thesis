Photorealism is a genre of art that can be used through painting, drawing and other styles. It is a genre of art where the artist studies a photograph and then attempts to reproduce that image as realistically as possible in another medium. They often project it onto canvas allowing images to be replicated with precision and accuracy. Photorealism is basically an American art movement in which artists attempt to recreate the image in a photo using a different artistic medium such as drawing, pastels, painting, charcoal, etc. Photorealism doesnâ€™t always have to be on a canvas, it could also be a sculpture or something else. It just has to be something that can recreate an image as precisely as possible making it look exactly like the thing they took inspiration from/tried to copy
